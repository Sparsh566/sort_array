# sort_array

sorting an array using bubble sort .
Bubble Sort Algorithm – A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
Array (int arr[] = {8,5,4,6,7,3,9};) – An integer array is used to store the elements that need to be sorted.
Size Calculation (sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0])) – This determines the number of elements in the array.
Nested Loops (for loops) – Used for iterating over the array and performing comparisons/swaps.
Conditional Statement (if condition) – Checks if adjacent elements need to be swapped.
Swapping Elements (temp variable) – A temporary variable is used to swap two elements in the array.
Looping through the array (for loop) to print the sorted elements.
printf() function – Used to print the sorted array.
main() function – The entry point of the C program.
